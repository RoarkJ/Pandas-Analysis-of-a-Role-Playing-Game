Observations for Heroes of Pymoli data:
1.) There are many more male players than female and other/non-disclosed gender categories combined. This fact carried through in all of the gender analysis for total purchases.

2.) Average purchase analysis throughout showed per player based on gender very similar purchase totals.  So, each player regardless of gender spend about the same amount of money.

3.) In all sections where age was taken into account players ages 20-24 dominated by number and total purchases.  This is clearly the single age group most interested in this game.
